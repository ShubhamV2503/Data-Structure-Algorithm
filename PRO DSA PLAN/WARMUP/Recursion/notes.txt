def recursion(n):

    if n == 0:
        return 0  ## Now process start to send answer upward
    
    return n + recursion(n-1)



Time complexity taken by recursion while expanding is stored in form of stack:

and when it got his answer and moves upward to finally return answer.
At each step it pop his element from stack and ultimatly my memory gets constant which is O(1)

So, TC --> TC O(N)
    SC --> O(1)
